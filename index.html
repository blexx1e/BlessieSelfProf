         <h3>Self Introduction </h3>
      <p> 
         I am currently pursuing Information Technology at Marinduque State college. I came from Silangan, Mogpog, Marinduque, a place known for having happy people. My journey in education has been quite diverse, which has enriched me with varied perspectives. Outside the classroom, I'm passionate about reading books, and I've been involved in sports that have allowed me to develop my physical and mental health. I'm excited to connect with the people in my surroundings and learn together in this new chapter of our academic lives.
